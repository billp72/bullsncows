A basic word game where one has to guess the isogram of a chosen length (an isogram is a word with non-repeating letters)

Windos console game

TODO add nice text graphics

1. chose a word length
2. start guessing non-repeating letters 

Hint: what works for me is to start at a random consonant on the keyboard and simply chose the adjancent letter. Keep selecting until you've reach the chosen length.
